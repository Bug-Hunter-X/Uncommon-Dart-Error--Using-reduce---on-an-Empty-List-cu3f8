# Uncommon Dart Error: reduce() on Empty List

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur in Dart when using the `reduce()` method on an empty list.  The `reduce()` method requires at least one element; attempting to use it on an empty list throws a `StateError`. This example shows the error and how to handle it gracefully.

## Code
The `bug.dart` file contains the code that demonstrates the error.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a solution.
